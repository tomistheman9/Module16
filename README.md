Elevator Pitch

Old Elevator Pitch
"Hi, I’m Tom. I recently transitioned from a successful career in HVAC where I was known for my  top-tier customer service and attention to detail, to now programming through the use of a Bootcamp called Codeboxx. My passion for programming has been with me since childhood, inspired by my father, who worked on top-secret government programming projects during the Cold War. I’ve spent years studying the history of computer science, dabbling in coding and admiring the pioneers who shaped the field. Now I am skilled in Java, JavaScript, Ruby, React, and Node and I recently took part with a team that went on to win at the Tampa Bay Hackathon at USF. I’m eager to bring my technical expertise, dedication and lifelong enthusiasm for programming to your development team and I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute and grow with your company!”
